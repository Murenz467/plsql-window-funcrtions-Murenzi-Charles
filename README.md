### Project Overview
AgriGrow Rwanda is a national agricultural cooperative connecting over 2,000 smallholder farmers across multiple districts. This project implements advanced PL/SQL window functions to analyze agricultural data and provide actionable insights for improved decision-making. Problem Definition

### Business Context
AgriGrow Rwanda specializes in staple crops (maize, beans, rice) while diversifying into high-value horticulture (tomatoes, avocados). The cooperative purchases crops from farmers, manages storage facilities, and distributes produce to wholesale markets and retail stores.

### Data Challenge
The cooperative lacks visibility into:

Crop dominance across regions and seasons

Top-performing farmers and their contributions

Monthly production trends and growth patterns

Effective farmer segmentation for targeted support

Expected Outcome
Using PL/SQL window functions to provide:

Regional crop rankings and seasonal analysis

Cumulative yield tracking and growth monitoring

Farmer performance segmentation

Production trend smoothing for better forecasting

### Success Criteria
Goal	Window Function	Analysis Type
1. Top 5 crops per region/season	RANK()	Regional crop rankings
2. Running monthly yield totals	SUM() OVER()	Running totals
3. Month-over-month growth %	LAG() / LEAD()	Growth trends
4. Farmer quartile segmentation	NTILE(4)	Farmer segmentation
5. 3-month moving average	AVG() OVER()	Trend smoothing
Detailed Goals:

Identify top 5 crops per region/season for targeted planning

Track running monthly yields for early gap detection

Measure month-over-month growth, flagging declines >15%

Segment farmers into quartiles (Q1 = high performers, Q4 = low performers)

Apply 3-month moving averages for improved forecasting

Window Functions Queries
1. Top 5 Crops per Region/Season (RANK)
```
sql
SELECT f.region,
       c.crop_name,
       TO_CHAR(y.yield_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS season,
       SUM(y.quantity_kg) AS total_yield,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY f.region, TO_CHAR(y.yield_date, 'YYYY-MM')
                    ORDER BY SUM(y.quantity_kg) DESC) AS crop_rank
FROM yields y
JOIN farmers f ON y.farmer_id = f.farmer_id
JOIN crops c ON y.crop_id = c.crop_id
GROUP BY f.region, c.crop_name, TO_CHAR(y.yield_date, 'YYYY-MM');
Interpretation: Identifies the top 5 crops in each region by yield, helping AgriGrow prioritize high-performing crops per season.
```
```sql

2. Running Monthly Yield Totals (SUM OVER)
sql
SELECT TO_CHAR(yield_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
       SUM(quantity_kg) AS monthly_total,
       SUM(SUM(quantity_kg)) OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(yield_date, 'YYYY-MM')) AS running_total
FROM yields
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(yield_date, 'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY month;
Interpretation: Calculates monthly yields and cumulative totals to track production growth trends.
```
``` sql

3. Month-over-Month Growth Rate (LAG)
sql
SELECT month,
       monthly_total,
       LAG(monthly_total, 1) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS prev_month,
       ROUND(((monthly_total - LAG(monthly_total, 1) OVER (ORDER BY month))
              / LAG(monthly_total, 1) OVER (ORDER BY month)) * 100, 2) AS growth_percent
FROM (
    SELECT TO_CHAR(yield_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
           SUM(quantity_kg) AS monthly_total
    FROM yields
    GROUP BY TO_CHAR(yield_date, 'YYYY-MM')
) t
ORDER BY month;
Interpretation: Shows month-over-month yield changes, allowing detection of sudden production drops or surges.
```
```sql

4. Farmer Quartile Segmentation (NTILE)
sql
SELECT f.farmer_id,
       f.name,
       f.region,
       SUM(y.quantity_kg) AS total_yield,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(y.quantity_kg) DESC) AS quartile
FROM farmers f
JOIN yields y ON f.farmer_id = y.farmer_id
GROUP BY f.farmer_id, f.name, f.region
ORDER BY total_yield DESC;
Interpretation: Segments farmers into quartiles to identify high-performing vs. low-performing farmers for targeted support.
```
```sql

5. 3-Month Moving Average (AVG OVER)
sql
SELECT month,
       monthly_total,
       ROUND(AVG(monthly_total) OVER (ORDER BY month ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW), 2) AS moving_avg_3m
FROM (
    SELECT TO_CHAR(yield_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
           SUM(quantity_kg) AS monthly_total
    FROM yields
    GROUP BY TO_CHAR(yield_date, 'YYYY-MM')
) t
ORDER BY month;
Interpretation: Provides smoothed yield trends, reducing seasonal noise and improving forecasting accuracy.

ðŸ“Š Results Analysis
Descriptive Analysis (What happened?)
Maize and beans dominate production in Nyagatare and Musanze regions

Seasonal yield drops observed in Juneâ€“July period

Top 25% of farmers contribute over 60% of total yields

Horticulture crops show steady but lower volumes compared to staples

Diagnostic Analysis (Why did it happen?)
Climate variation caused reduced yields mid-year due to drought conditions

Regions with irrigation projects showed higher productivity

High performers benefited from training and improved inputs

Rain-fed agriculture regions experienced more volatility

Prescriptive Analysis (What next?)
Expand irrigation support to low-performing regions

Focus training programs on Q3â€“Q4 farmers to improve productivity

Diversify crops in maize-dependent regions to reduce risk

Implement predictive early warning systems using moving averages

Strengthen post-harvest storage in high-producing regions
